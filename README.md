This project is a template for creating SPAs or "Hybrid SPAs". It uses the popular React Router for client-side routing, as we as utilizes Next's built-in router for both [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) and  [Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering).


The project was originally bootstrapped by [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). So all modifications should work for your typical Next.js app after v9.5.
